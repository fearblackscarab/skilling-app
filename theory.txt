main currency is influence.

other currency's can be used to buy things to increase influence.

Upgrades:

need to figure out multi purchase of upgrades possibly using a (cost*multiplier) to the power of purchase amount state?

currency theory:

options 1:chains down to kevins who work for influence

option 2: each gen has a value for increasing influence

option 3: have more then 1 currency earned per generator
    
     example: kevin earns money and influence, karens make kevins and influence

    each generator has different outputs changing assigned to an array and i'll need to check for currency's also not just influencers.

    use kevin to alter currency's based on the assigned array.

tier 1=(tier 2*multiplier)+tier 1
tier 2= 1;
